# bsc-feature-extractor
Extracts features between two versions of a file inside Gerrit Code Review.

## Overview
1. [Features](#features)  
1.1 [Code-Metrics](#code-metrics)  
1.2 [Change-Metrics](#change-metrics)  
1.3 [ASAT-Metrics](#asat-metrics)  
1.4 [CK-Metrics](#ck-metrics)  
1.5 [Low-level Source Code Changes](#low-level-source-code-changes)  
1.6 [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)  


## Features 

Feature | How it works
---|---
**Code-Metrics** | Static Code Information (SLOC, BLOC etc.)
**Change-Metrics** | Information about change information (Authors, Lines changed, Code Churn etc.)
**ASAT-Metrics** | Static Analysis Warnings from PMD and Checkstyle
**CK-Metrics** | Object-Oriented Information (WMC, DIT, etc.)
**Low-level Source Code Changes** | Low level change-types extracted from ChangeDistiller
**Commit Messages (NLP)** | Term frequency metrics of the commit message (tf-idf)
